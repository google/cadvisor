// Strategy defines a function that Retry calls before every successive attempt
// to determine whether it should make the next attempt or not. Returning `true`
// allows for the next attempt to be made. Returning `false` halts the retrying
// process and returns the last error returned by the called Action.
//
// The strategy will be passed an "attempt" number on each successive retry
// iteration, starting with a `0` value before the first attempt is actually
// made. This allows for a pre-action delay, etc.
